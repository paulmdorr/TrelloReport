# Umami Happy Report

Report tool to get a list of the actions executed on Trello board's cards during a period of time, made by Paul M Dorr for [Umami Collective](http://www.umamicollective.com)

### Prerequisities

You will need to have node.js installed if you want it to work without any issues. You could also just open the index.html file in the "app" directory, but you could run into redirection issues with the Trello auth page.

### Installing

All you need to get this app working is run the http server with:

```
npm start
```

That should take care of everything for you and start the server up, but if you run into any kind of issues, try running the following first:

```
npm install
bower install
```

Then just go to

```
http://localhost:800
```
